Problem Statement

Traditional Finance Challenges:
• Centralized control and single points of failure
• High transaction fees from intermediaries
• Limited accessibility to financial services
• Lack of transparency in operations
• Trust dependency on third parties

Our Solution:
A decentralized platform enabling trustless token staking and peer-to-peer swapping

---

Project Overview

• Custom ERC-20 Tokens (DFI and REW)
• Token Staking with Time-based Rewards
• Decentralized Token Swap Exchange
• Modern React Frontend
• MetaMask Wallet Integration

Built with security and user experience in mind

Smart Contracts:
• DeFiToken Contract
• StakingPool Contract  
• TokenSwap Contract

---

Smart Contract #1: DeFiToken

Purpose: ERC-20 compliant token implementation

Key Features:
• Standard token functionality
• Initial supply: 1,000,000 tokens
• 18 decimal places
• Secure transfer mechanisms

Functions: transfer, approve, balanceOf, totalSupply

---

Smart Contract #2: StakingPool

Purpose: Enable token staking with rewards

Key Features:
• Stake DFI tokens to earn REW rewards
• Time-based reward calculation (1% per second)
• Withdraw staked tokens anytime
• Claim accumulated rewards
• ReentrancyGuard protection

Reward Formula: (Staked Amount × Time × Rate) / 100

---

Smart Contract #3: TokenSwap

Purpose: Decentralized token exchange

Key Features:
• Swap DFI ↔ REW tokens
• Fixed exchange rate (1:2)
• Instant execution
• Liquidity pool management
• No intermediaries

Exchange: 1 DFI = 2 REW

---
