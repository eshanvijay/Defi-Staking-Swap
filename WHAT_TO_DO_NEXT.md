## ✅ You're Connected! Now Test the App

### Step 1: Check Your Balances (Home Page)

1. You should be on the **Home** page
2. Look at the stats cards - you should see:
   - **DFI Token Balance**: Should show a number (like 1000000 or similar)
   - **Reward Token Balance**: Should show a number
3. If balances show "0" or "Loading...":
   - Wait a few seconds (they load automatically)
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - Make sure you're using the imported account (Account 2) in MetaMask

### Step 2: Test Token Staking

1. Click **"Stake"** in the navigation bar (top)
2. You'll see:
   - Your staked balance (should be 0 initially)
   - Pending rewards (should be 0 initially)
   - Available balance (your DFI tokens)
3. **Stake some tokens:**
   - Enter an amount (like `100` or `1000`)
   - Click **"Stake Tokens"**
   - MetaMask will pop up - click **"Confirm"**
   - Wait for transaction confirmation
   - Your staked balance should update!
4. **Wait a few seconds** - rewards accumulate over time
5. **Claim rewards:**
   - After staking, wait 10-20 seconds
   - You'll see "Pending Rewards" increase
   - Click **"Claim Rewards"**
   - Approve in MetaMask
   - Your reward token balance will increase!

### Step 3: Test Token Swap

1. Click **"Swap"** in the navigation bar
2. You'll see:
   - Exchange rate (1 DFI = 2 REW)
   - Your DFI balance
   - Your REW balance
3. **Swap tokens:**
   - Enter an amount (like `50`)
   - The output amount is calculated automatically
   - Click **"Swap Tokens"**
   - Approve in MetaMask (if needed)
   - Confirm the swap
   - Your balances will update!

### Step 4: View Your Profile

1. Click **"Profile"** in the navigation bar
2. You'll see:
   - Your wallet address
   - Total portfolio value
   - All token balances
   - Staked amount
   - Pending rewards
   - **Transaction history** (all your staking, swapping, etc.)

### Step 5: Take Screenshots for Your Report

Take screenshots of:
1. ✅ Home page with connected wallet
2. ✅ Stake page showing staked tokens
